# Background #

At [Burning Man](http://www.burningman.com/) and related events, small and large groups of Artists endeavour to create works for the community, while Theme Camps organize infrastructure for small and large groups of like-minded participants.

For artists, food is usually at best a secondary concern.  A small selection of non-perishable items is frequently the extent of their menu for the often-grueling, days-long effort of assembling their work on the playa.

For theme camps, food is often a primary focus of the organizational effort well before arrival on-playa.  Many theme camps, even small ones, bring fairly well-equipped kitchens and have arrangements to handle preparation and serving of really good food.

[Feed The Artists](http://www.feedtheartists.net/) has had great luck coordinating these two constituencies so that the gifting economy of Burning Man can be extended to the dinner table.  In 2008, we coordinated 674 meals hosted by six theme camps.  In 2010, 50 theme camps served over 1500 meals to artists on the playa.

# Problem Statement #

This organization effort requires a lot of planning overhead when managed manually via spreadsheets and email.  In order to expand meal gifting at Burning Man, as well as to enable similar programs at other related events, a dedicated Online Reservation System is necessary.

# Goals #

  1. Give event, theme camp, and art group organizers the easiest possible way to publish their information and discover each other.
  1. Provide published information in a format that is maximally useful for participants when they are at the event.
  1. Make it easy for the FtA concept to be spread virally through related communities.
